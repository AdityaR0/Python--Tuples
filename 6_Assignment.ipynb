    "Q1. What is a tuple in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans:)Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.\n",
    "Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data.\n",
    "Tuples are immutable,they cannot be changed once they are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How do you create a tuple in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "ans:)\n",
    "Tuple1 = ()\n",
    "print(\"empty Tuple \")\n",
    "print(Tuple1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is the difference between a tuple and a list in Python?\n",
    "Ans:)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Lists:)\n",
    "1)List are mutable\n",
    "2)Iterations are time-consuming\n",
    "3)Inserting and deleting items is easier with a list.\n",
    "4)Lists consume more memory.\n",
    "5)Lists have several built-in methods.\n",
    "6)A unexpected change or error is more likely to occur in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Tuples:)\n",
    "1)Tuples are immutable.\n",
    "2)Iterations are comparatively Faster\n",
    "3)Accessing the elements is best accomplished with a tuple data type.\n",
    "4)Tuple consumes less than the list.\n",
    "5)A tuple does not have many built-in methods because of immutability\n",
    "6)In a tuple, changes and errors don't usually occur because of immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Can a tuple be changed in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:)Tuples are unchangeable,It cannot change, add, or remove items once the tuple is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How do you access elements in a tuple?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:)We can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets.\n",
    "Example:-\n",
    "thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "print(thistuple[1])\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. How do you unpack a tuple in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:)When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called \"packing\" a tuple.\n",
    "But,we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called \"unpacking\".\n",
    "Example:-\n",
    "fruits = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "\n",
    "(green, yellow, red) = fruits\n",
    "\n",
    "print(green)\n",
    "print(yellow)\n",
    "print(red)\n"
